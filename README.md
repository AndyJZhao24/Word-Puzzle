# Word-Puzzle

Given 3 words as input, the program will produce a mapping for each unique character in the words to an integer if a solution exists.
Run the main.cpp file in the /app dir to start.
solver.cpp in /app contains the code for the puzzleSolver function.

I.e, 
Given Word1 as POT, Word2 as PAN, Word3 as BIB.
The program will return the first valid mapping(char,int) found for the solution to the equation POT + PAN = BIB.
